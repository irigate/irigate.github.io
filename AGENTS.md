# Irigate website

## Purpose

Static Astro website for `https://irigate.io`, including product pages, public documentation, SEO endpoints, and deterministic built-output checks.

## Ownership

- `src/content/` owns substantive public product and documentation copy.
- `src/content.config.ts` owns Astro content collection loaders and frontmatter schemas for `src/content/`.
- Astro pages, layouts, components, and styles own routing and presentation.
- `public/` owns files copied directly into the deployed site.
- `scripts/` owns website-specific generation and built-output verification.
- `irigate/irigate-mcp-proxy` owns authoritative behavior, architecture, benchmark evidence, and source brand assets; this repository owns their public website representation.
- `.github/workflows/` owns website validation and GitHub Pages deployment.
- `GITHUB-PAGES.md` owns custom-domain setup, verification, operations, and rollback.

## Local Contracts

- Keep output static and rooted at `https://irigate.io`; do not configure a repository `base` path.
- Keep product claims within the loopback-only broker boundary and measured evidence in the root documents.
- Hand-synchronize affected website content in the same change as changes to root behavior or evidence documents. Do not parse root Markdown at build time.
- Use Markdown for prose-heavy documentation and MDX only where reusable Astro components are needed.
- Use framework-free JavaScript only for concrete interactions such as theme preference and command copying.
- The theme preference key is `irigate.theme`; store only `light`, `dark`, or `system`, and apply the effective `light|dark` value as `data-theme` on the root element.
- Keep `dist/`, `.astro/`, and `node_modules/` generated and untracked.
- Keep dependency install scripts denied unless explicitly approved in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; esbuild is the reviewed baseline exception required by Astro.
- Bind development and preview servers to loopback unless an operator explicitly chooses otherwise.
- Keep `public/logo.svg` and `public/logo-mark.svg` byte-for-byte synchronized from `irigate/irigate-mcp-proxy`'s `assets/`; `public/favicon.svg` is a direct mark copy unless a later durable contract replaces it.
- Keep `public/og-default.png` site-owned at exactly 1200x630; do not generate it by changing the source repository's `assets/build_logo.py`.
- Keep `public/CNAME` exactly `irigate.io` with one trailing newline; the built-site verifier treats it as required custom-domain intent.
- Generate `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` from Astro endpoints using `Astro.site` and validated content metadata; keep `llms.txt` concise, ordered as `Docs`, `Evidence`, `Source`, `Optional`, and free of `GITHUB-PAGES.md`.
- Emit JSON-LD only through `SeoHead.astro`: `SoftwareApplication` on the homepage and `FAQPage` on `/docs/faq/`; visible FAQ answers must match structured answers.

## Work Guidance

- Use semantic design tokens for both light and dark palettes; do not hard-code mode-specific colors in components.
- Preserve ordinary links, visible HTML content, keyboard operation, reduced-motion behavior, and readability without JavaScript.
- Reuse the generated brand SVGs from `assets/` without changing their geometry.

## Verification

- Run `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` from the repository root.
- Run `corepack pnpm verify` from the repository root; it performs Astro type checking, production build, and deterministic built-site assertions.
- Preview with `corepack pnpm preview --host 127.0.0.1`.
